## Backend:
1. Secure Authentication APIs (register users - login users).
2. A task management system where users can create, edit, and delete tasks(CRUD).
3. Each task should consist of (id, title, status, time spent on the task, and user who created the task).
4. Users should have access to perform CRUD operations on their tasks only.
5. User should search their tasks by title.
6. A time tracking (Timer) system where users can track the time they spend on each task.
7. Tracking tasks should be using a clock-in and clock-out mechanism where the time spent on each task is calculated by the (clock-out timestamp - clock-in
timestamp), but feel free to adopt other methodologies.
8. Return time spent on the task for each task.
   
Used the following technologies:
- NestJS for the backend
- MongoDB

## Frontend:
1. Login and Registration Pages.
2. After users log in/ registration flow, users should be redirected to the homepage.
3. The homepage should be protected for logged-in users only.
4. Users should view their tasks on the homepage.
5. Users should perform the task CRUD operations from the homepage.
6. The homepage should include a search input at the top, allowing users to search for tasks.
7. Users should track only one task at a time
8. While a task is being tracked, the time counter should be updated in the format of (HH:MM:SS) to reflect the time elapsed.
9. A time tracking system that integrates with the backend time tracking system

Used the following technologies:
- React.js
- Bootstrap Framework for UI.
